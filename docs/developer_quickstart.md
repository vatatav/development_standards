# Developer Quickstart Guide

## 1. Introduction

This document provides practical, step-by-step instructions for common development tasks within this workspace. It is intended as a quick reference or "How to..." guide.

For the detailed philosophy, standards, and formal procedures, always refer to the other documents in the `development_standards` project, such as `standards.md` and `project_lifecycle_guidelines.md`.

## 2. How to: Start a New Project

This is a condensed checklist for creating a new project from scratch.

1.  **Create Directory:** In the `./03_projects/` directory, create a new folder for your project (e.g., `./03_projects/python/my_new_project/`).
2.  **Add Foundational Files:** Copy the standard foundational files into the new project's root:
    * `.gitignore`
    * `LICENSE`
    * `generate_project_manifest.ps1`
    * `run_manifest_generator.bat`
3.  **Create `README.md`:** Write a project-specific `README.md` that explains its purpose and setup instructions.
4.  **Create Internal Structure:** Create the `src/`, `docs/`, and `logs/` directories.
5.  **Initialize Git & Commit:** From the project's root directory, run the following commands, replacing the commit message as appropriate:
    ```bash
    git init -b main
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Initial commit of the my_new_project project (S0016-MNP-C01-20250624-1)"
    ```
6.  **Create Remote & Push:** Create a new public repository on GitHub (without any files) and push your initial commit:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
    git push -u origin main
    ```
7.  **Create Initial Logs:** Manually create the first entries in the project's `llm_assisted_development_log.md`, `user_progress_log.md`, and `sessions.md` files in the `./logs/` directory.

## 3. How to: Start Work on an Existing Project

This is the standard workflow for beginning a new feature or bug fix.

1.  **Initiate a New Conversation:** Start a new, formal conversation with an LLM assistant. This marks the beginning of a new project-specific conversation (e.g., `C02`).
2.  **Perform Takeover:** Follow the `llm_takeover_procedures.md` to onboard the LLM, ensuring it understands the project's state. This will result in a new `TO_...md` file in the `./logs/` directory.
3.  **Create Initial Logs:** Create the first log entries for the new conversation (`C02`) in the project's log files.
4.  **Create a New Branch:** Before writing any code, create a new feature or fix branch from `main`:
    ```bash
    # For a new feature
    git checkout -b feature/brief-description

    # For a bug fix
    git checkout -b fix/brief-description
    ```
5.  **Begin Development:** You can now begin the iterative process of coding, testing, and committing your changes.

## 4. How to: Use the Multi-Agent Framework

When working on the `multi-agent-framework` project itself (or any other project configured to use it):

1.  **Verify Runtime Files:** Ensure the project root contains the two runtime configuration files, which are ignored by Git:
    * `.roomodes` (contains agent definitions)
    * `.agent_workflows` (contains workflow logic)
    * **Note:** These files should be generated by copying their source-controlled counterparts from the `src/` directory.
2.  **Select a Workflow:** Before starting, review `src/agent_workflows.json` and ensure the desired workflow (e.g., `"Default_Rapid_Prototype"`) is set as the active one, or instruct the `Dispatcher` which one to use.
3.  **Engage the `Dispatcher`:** Start your prompt by addressing the `Dispatcher` agent and clearly stating your task. The `Dispatcher` will handle the rest according to the active workflow.

## 5. How to: Finalize and Hand Over Your Work

This checklist concludes a development conversation.

1.  **Finalize Commits:** Ensure all your work is committed in small, atomic commits on your feature branch.
2.  **Open a Pull Request:** Push your branch to GitHub and open a Pull Request to merge your changes into the `main` branch. Add a clear description.
3.  **Merge the PR:** After review, merge the Pull Request.
4.  **Follow Handover Procedure:** Initiate the handover process with your LLM assistant by following `llm_handover_procedures.md`. This will result in a new `HO_...md` file in `./logs/` and the finalization of all log entries for the conversation.
