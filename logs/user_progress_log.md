**Topic:** Formalizing the Development Standards Project
**Insights & Learnings:**
* This collection of documents has been promoted to a first-class project, recognizing that the methodology itself is a key deliverable that requires its own lifecycle and version control.
* The process of setting up this project immediately highlighted areas for improvement, leading to the "dogfooding" approach of updating the standards as they are being formalized.

**Topic:** Codifying New Workspace Architecture into Standards
**Insights & Learnings:**
* The process of meticulously updating each procedural document forced a clarification of all the new rules we had established during the refactoring.
* Realized that a simple "patch" is insufficient when the underlying architecture changes; a full review and rewrite is necessary.
* The creation of new, more practical documents like `developer_quickstart.md` and the `takeover_context.md` template is a significant improvement over the old system, making the entire process more robust for future use.
