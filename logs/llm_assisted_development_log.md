**DS-C01 Session Start:** 2025.06.22 23:11
**Commit Counter: 1**
**Mode:** Gemini Web Interface
**LLM Model:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (preview)
**Source:** S0015-20250621_Gemini-Web-Interface_Gemini-2.5-Pro-preview.md

**ItemID:** DS-C01-ADL-20250622-001-S0015
**Date:** 2025.06.22
**Phase:** Project Initialization & Structuring
**LLM Interactions - Actions:**
* Project created as a result of the "Project Mitosis" from the parent `roo_code_LLM_universe` project.
* Initial file structure was refined to move all procedural documents into a `docs/` subdirectory.
* Foundational files (`README.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, utility scripts) were created.
* A new Git repository was initialized and the initial project state was committed (Commit `699bdde`).
**User Insights Recorded:** User established that the development methodology itself is a first-class project requiring its own version control and lifecycle. User identified that clear, explicit rules for LLM interaction (like commit message formatting) should be codified directly into the standards to prevent future errors.

**ItemID:** DS-C01-ADL-20250622-002-S0015
**Date:** 2025.06.24
**Phase:** Comprehensive Documentation Overhaul
**LLM Interactions - Actions:**
* A systematic, section-by-section review and update of all procedural documents was performed.
* **`llm_handover_procedures.md`:** Updated the filename format to the new `HO_[PRJ]_S..._C...` standard and corrected the output directory to `./logs/`.
* **`llm_takeover_procedures.md`:** Updated the filename format to the new `TO_[PRJ]_S..._C...` standard and updated all file path references to align with the new workspace structure.
* **`logging_procedures_guidelines.md`:** Performed a complete rewrite to formalize the dual-level logging system, the new `ItemID` and `sessions.md` formats, and the log file locations.
* **`standards.md`:** Performed a major refactoring to generalize the document. Separated "Universal Principles" from "Python-Specific Standards" and removed outdated project structure definitions. Added the new standard for Git commit message subjects.
* **`llm_takeover_prompt.md` & `llm_takeover_prompt_WEB.md`:** Deprecated both files and replaced them with a new, more robust two-file system: `takeover_prompt.md` (a unified prompt) and `takeover_context.md` (a dynamic context template).
* **`project_lifecycle_guidelines.md` & `workflow_guide.md`:** Deprecated both outdated files. Created a new `project_lifecycle_guidelines.md` from scratch and a new `developer_quickstart.md` to serve as a practical "How to..." guide.
**User Insights Recorded:** User initiated a deep refactoring of all procedural documents to ensure they are internally consistent and accurately reflect the new multi-project architecture, preventing future LLM confusion.
