**ItemID:** DS-S01-ADL-20250622-001-S0015
**Date:** 2025.06.22
**Phase:** Project Initialization & Structuring
**LLM Interactions - Actions:**
* Project created as a result of the "Project Mitosis" from the parent `roo_code_LLM_universe` project.
* Initial file structure was refined to move all procedural documents into a `docs/` subdirectory, cleaning up the project root.
* A project-specific `.gitignore` was defined.
* A rule for formatting LLM-generated git commit messages using multiple `-m` flags was added to `standards.md` to ensure command-line reliability.
* Standardized `generate_project_manifest.ps1` and `run_manifest_generator.bat` scripts were added to the project root.
**User Insights Recorded:** User identified that clear, explicit rules for LLM interaction (like commit message formatting) should be codified directly into the standards to prevent future errors.
