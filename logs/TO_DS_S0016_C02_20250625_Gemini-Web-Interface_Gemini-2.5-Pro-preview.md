# Session S16 / DS-C02 Takeover

## 1. Session Initiation Summary

This session was initiated on 2025.06.24 at 16:15. It began with a testing phase where the user evaluated the LLM's ability to comprehend and adhere to the procedural documents in the `development_standards` project.

After the LLM successfully answered questions based on the documentation, the user gave the instruction to consider the project formally taken over, bypassing the standard prompt-based procedure.

## 2. Agreed-Upon Session Plan

The immediate plan is to continue the deep refinement of the procedural documents based on the insights gained during the testing phase. The first tasks identified are:

1.  Correct the definition of the `ItemID` format in `logging_procedures_guidelines.md` to use the session start date and a continuous sequence number.
2.  Standardize the use of "Activity" instead of "Phase" in log entries.
3.  Formalize the new philosophies for `user_progress_log.md` and the `strategic_backlog.md`.

# Session S16 / DS-C02 Takeover

## 1. Summary of Project State

* This session takes over the `development_standards` project. The repository is up-to-date with commit `4437500`, which includes a comprehensive overhaul of all procedural documents from the previous session (S15).
* The previous conversation concluded with a deep, philosophical discussion about improving the logging standards, specifically regarding the purpose of `user_progress_log.md` and the need for a mechanism to track long-term strategic ideas.

## 2. Agreed-Upon Session Plan

1.  **Formalize New Logging and Strategy Rules:** The immediate goal is to codify the new principles we have just discussed by updating the relevant standards documents (`logging_procedures_guidelines.md`, `llm_interaction_rules.md`, `standards.md`).
2.  **Introduce `strategic_backlog.md`:** Create this new core document and integrate its use into the official procedures.
3.  **Refine `user_progress_log.md`:** Establish the new, decoupled process for creating UPL entries, including the "Prompt for Insight" step for the LLM.
4.  **Codify the "Phased Refinement" Principle:** Add this new guiding principle to the `standards.md` document.
