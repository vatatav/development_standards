# Project Handover Report: development_standards

## 1. Project Status Summary

* **Project:** `development_standards`
* **Handover Date:** 2025.06.25
* **Current State:** The project is stable. The primary achievement of this session (S16) was a complete and thorough overhaul of all core procedural documents, including logging, takeover, handover, and lifecycle guidelines. These documents are now considered the new gold standard.
* **Last Commit:** A commit containing the final versions of all updated standards documents has been made.

## 2. Key Accomplishments in This Session

* **Finalized All Procedural Documents:** All standards documents have been rewritten to be unambiguous, comprehensive, and mutually consistent.
* **Redefined UPL:** The purpose of the `user_progress_log.md` has been philosophically redefined to be a "User's Diary," distinct from the development log.
* **Created Strategic Backlog:** A new core document, `strategic_backlog.md`, was conceived and integrated into the standards to track long-term ideas.
* **Mandated Procedures:** The standards now explicitly mandate that the handover and takeover procedures must be followed.

## 3. CRITICAL: LLM Performance Failure

It is of utmost importance that the incoming LLM understands the reason for this handover. The previous LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Session S16) repeatedly and critically failed to adhere to the primary interaction rule: maintaining the English language. This failure occurred three times after repeated user correction.

**Action for incoming LLM:** You must treat this as a critical data point. Before proceeding with any work, you must re-read and confirm your understanding of all rules in `llm_interaction_rules.md`. Acknowledge this specific failure in your initial takeover summary to the user.

## 4. Next Recommended Actions

1.  **Strictly Validate Takeover:** The next LLM must perform a takeover by strictly adhering to the updated `llm_takeover_procedures.md`.
2.  **Apply New Standards:** The next logical step is to apply these new, robust standards to a different project to validate their effectiveness in a real-world scenario.
3.  **Populate Backlog:** Continue to populate the `strategic_backlog.md` with any new, long-term ideas that arise during development.
